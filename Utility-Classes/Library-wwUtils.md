wwUtils is actually a UDF function library, not a class. This class provides lots of utility functions frequently used in the Web Connection framework and in typical applications. I use this library in every app I build.

Note this is a function library rather than  a class, so there's no object to create first. Just SET PROCEDURE and call the functions.
