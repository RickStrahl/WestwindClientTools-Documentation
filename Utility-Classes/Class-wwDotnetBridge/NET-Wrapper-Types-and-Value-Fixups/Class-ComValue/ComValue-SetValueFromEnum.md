Sets the ComValue structure to the specified Enum value.Use this implementation instead of wwDotnetBridge::GetEnumValue() when the property, method or constructor has multiple overloads and the type conversion from enum to integer of GetEnumValue() won't find the correct member signature in .NET (Method not found error for example). Using the COM value allows you to pass the actual Enum rather than the constant that identifies it and so the call can find the exact .NET signature.
