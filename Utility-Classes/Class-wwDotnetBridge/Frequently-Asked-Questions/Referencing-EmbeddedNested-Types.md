If you are using the various indirect wwDotnetBridge methods to access 'embedded types' that are nested within another .NET type the type referencing syntax has to include a `+` instead of a `.` when traversing the nested type.For example:```foxproloBridge = CreateObject("wwDotNetBridge","V4")? loBridge.LoadAssembly("c:\users\rick\documents\visual studio 2013\Projects\Lucene\Lucene\bin\debug\lucene.net.dll")? loBridge.getStaticProperty( "Lucene.Net.Index.IndexWriter+MaxFieldLength","LIMITED" )```Notice the + in before the MaxFieldLength property.The IndexWriter type in this case contains the MaxFieldLength type:```cspublic class IndexWriter {     ...     // Nested class     public class MaxFieldLength     {        public static readonly int LIMITED {get; set;}      }}```
