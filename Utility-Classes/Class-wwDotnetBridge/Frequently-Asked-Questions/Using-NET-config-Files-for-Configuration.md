Many .NET applications require configuration settings that are stored in `.config` files. If the components you are calling - like for example a WCF service client - require that you have a configuration file, your FoxPro application has to provide this `.config` file.### Where to put your .config FilesIn order to do this you need to create an `.config` file in the same location as the primary binary executable that is your application. This is either:* YourApplication.exe* VFP9.exe (running FoxPro IDE)The configuration file needs to live in the same path as the EXE as:* **YourApplication.exe.config*** **VFP9.exe.config**Note that the latter is global and will located in the VFP9 installation folder in *Programs Files (x86)* most likely.
