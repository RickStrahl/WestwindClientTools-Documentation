Creates an instance of a [ComValue](vfps://Topic/_3481232SD) object which allows you to capture values from method calls and properties and keep them in .NET. #### Use for Problem TypesUse this object to pass **problem types** that don't translate between FoxPro and .NET (arrays, NULLS, Structs etc.) #### Use for Reference ParametersIf you need to pass parameters to a function `byRef`, you can use ComValue to pass the parameter. Simply create a ComValue object and assign the value. Any call to `InvokeMethod()` (or one of its variants) that receives a ComValue object parameter stores that parameter and reassigns it after the method call. If the value changes the ComValue() object then holds the changed value on return of the method call.
