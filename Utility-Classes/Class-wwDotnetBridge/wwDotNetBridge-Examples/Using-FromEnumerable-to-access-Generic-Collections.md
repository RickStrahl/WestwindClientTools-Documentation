Generic types cannot be accessed directly via COM from FoxPro. Any attempt to access members of a generic type will cause FoxPro to crash with a physical C5 error.A common result from .NET methods are generic lists like `List<T>` and these lists - unlike arrays - are returned to FoxPro in their raw form. In order to access these lists you can convert them into ComArray instances with the following code:```foxpro*** Method that returns a Generic List<Employees>loEmps = loBridge.InvokeMethod( loTax, "GetList")? loEmps   && (Object)  (this is the generic type)*** Load Generic List into ComArray as EnumerableloItems = loBridge.CreateArray()loItems.FromEnumerable(loEmps)*** Now you can use ComArray methods as usualFor i = 0 to loItems.Count-1	loEmp = loItems.Item(i)	? i	? loEmp.Name	? loEmp.AmountEndFor ````.FromEnumerable` creates a new array from the generic list or any other type that implements `IEnumerable`. The array adds the same items of the list and thus makes the ComArray behave as you would expect.> #### @icon-warning FromEnumerable Overhead> `FromEnumerable()` essentially makes a copy of the enumerable list so there's overhead both in iterating over the input list as well as creating a new array that references each of the elements in the original collection. If using `FromEnumerable()` from a non-materialized data source it will effectively materialize all items.>> For this reason make sure you don't use this method on very large collections as it may be slow and use excessive amounts of memory.
