Returns the HTTP Result Code message based on the active [cResultCode](vfps://Topic/_0XY0UL6DP) property.

For example returns "Not Authorized" for a 401 result code, "Not Found" for a 404, "Server Error" for a 500. Most HTTP errors are mapped and returned in this fashion.

For more information on how result codes are captured please check the [cResultCode](vfps://Topic/_0XY0UL6DP) topic.
