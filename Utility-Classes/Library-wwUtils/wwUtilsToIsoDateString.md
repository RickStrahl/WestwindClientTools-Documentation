Converts a FoxPro date or date time or string value to ISO 8601 format: 2012-10-08 or  2014-10-01T16:55:12Z. Dates can be created with or without UTC time offsets.

This function is useful for converting dates to the format required by HTML5 input type=date controls which can only display dates using the standard ISO formatting.
