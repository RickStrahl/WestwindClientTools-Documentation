A SOAP proxy class that can be autogenerated using the CONSOLE WSDL Generation routines. 

This proxy class acts as a proxy to the underlying SOAP client. The generated class includes strongly typed methods and provides error handling for requests.

The classes generated are subclassed from wwSOAPPRoxy so they inherit the properties and methods here. Additionally each Web Service method will be reflected as a method on the Proxy object.
