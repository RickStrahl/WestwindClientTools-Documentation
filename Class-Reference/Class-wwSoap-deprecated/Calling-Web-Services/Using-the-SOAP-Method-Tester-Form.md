Web Connection also includes a SOAP method tester which allows you to call remote SOAP methods with an interactive user interface. You can load method signatures if an SDL file is available. You can access the method tester from the Web Connection|Tools menu (DO WCSTART) or `DO FORM SOAPMETHODTESTER`.

This allows you to quickly test new Web Services you create or Web Services published by other Web sites without writing manual code first.

The interface can use MS SOAP Toolkit style SDL files to discover type information for parameters and use that info in making the SOAP client call. You can review the SOAP messages by clicking on the SOAP Request and Response buttons. This is useful for learning about SOAP and also for troubleshooting bad requests.
