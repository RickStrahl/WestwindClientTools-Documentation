An instance member for an wwHTTPSQL class that handles data access over the Web when nDataMode is set to 4.

This member is created when Open() is called for the first time, or you can create the object yourself and set it. You can access this member after the call to the Open() method to configure HTTP settings like timeouts, authentication and proxy settings.
