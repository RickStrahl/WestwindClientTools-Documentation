The following are a few simple examples of using `wwBusinessObject` based on the following class:```foxproDEFINE CLASS cCustomer AS wwBusinessObjectcAlias = "Customers"cFilename = "Customers"cPkField = "Id"*************************************************************************  CreateNewId*******************************************  Function: Overridden from base to create Character key***    Assume: If you don't override this method the assumed***            type is integer and generating via lookup table***    Return: new Character id************************************************************************FUNCTION CreateNewId()RETURN SYS(2015)ENDFUNC*   CreateNewId*************************************************************************  Validate*******************************************  Function: Overrides Validation return .T. or .F. and set***            .oValidationErrors collection via `.AddValidationError()`***    Return: .T. or .F.************************************************************************FUNCTION Validate()THIS.oValidationErrors.Clear()IF EMPTY(THIS.oData.Company)   THIS.AddValidationError("Company can't be empty","Company")ENDIFRETURN this.oValidationErrors.Count > 0ENDFUNC*   ValidateENDDEFINE```Note you typically subclass `wwBusinessObject` and match it to a business entity that acts as a base of the business object. This doesn't have to be a one-to-one mapping - some business objects can represent complex objects like `Order` with subobjects for `Customer` and `LineItems`. The above is a simple business object mapped to a single object. ### QueriesYou can query data using the Query method, which lets you execute provider independent query. Assuming your queries work cross providers, a single query can be run against Fox data or Sql Server (or other ODBC backend) dependent on the `.nDataMode` property.Queries can be partial using just a `WHERE` clause or `SELECT <fieldListOr*>` and the `FROM` or `SELECT` and `INTO` clauses are automatically filled in.```foxproFUNCTION Query()loBus = CREATEOBJECT("cCustomer")*** Get all recordslnResult = loBus.Query()   && select * / TQUerythis.AssertTrue(lnResult > 0)this.MessageOut(TRANSFORM(lnResult) + " records queried")*** Get filtered records with augmented syntax (ie. no FROM clause)lnResult = loBus.Query([Where company = "West Wind"],"TCustomers")   && Select *this.AssertTrue(lnResult == 1)this.MessageOut(TRANSFORM(lnResult) + " records queried for West Wind")*** Explicit SQLlnResult = loBus.Query([Select id,company Where company = "West Wind"],"TCustomers") this.AssertTrue(lnResult == 1)this.MessageOut(TRANSFORM(lnResult) + " records queried for West Wind")```You should minimize using explicit query commands in your client code however and create specialized methods in the business object to return data. For example, in the `cCustomer`  class i may have a method called `GetRecentCustomers()` that I just pass a date to. The method would then create the appropriate SQL command to call with the Query method:```foxproFUNCTION GetRecentCustomers(ldDate as DateTime) as IntegerRETURN THIS.Query( "SELECT * where Updated > ?ldDate", "TCustomers"  )ENDFUNC```While this is a very simple example, even so it isolates the code in a single, logical location which makes this code easier to find and debug if something doesn't work or later needs to be updated.### Load and Save  Entity DataIt's easy to load entity data, make changes and save it.```foxproFUNCTION LoadAndSave()lcCompany = "East Wind Trade Company"loBus = CREATEOBJECT("cCustomer")*** Load a specific recordthis.AssertTrue(loBus.Load("_4FG12Y7UD"))loBus.oData.Company = lcCompanyloBus.oData.Updated = DATETIME()this.AssertTrue(loBus.Save())ENDFUNC```### Add and Delete EntitiesIt's just as easy to create a new entity, fill it with data, then save it.```foxproloBus = CREATEOBJECT("cCustomer")*** Add a new EntityloBus.New()loBus.oData.Company = "East India Deliveries"loBus.oData.FirstName = "Gaal"loBus.oData.LastName = "Dornick"loBus.oData.BillRate = 150loBus.oData.Entered = DateTime()this.AssertTrue(loBus.Save(),"Couldn't save new entity.")*** Capture the Pk for new entitylcId = loBus.oData.Id*** Remove the newly created entitythis.AssertTrue(loBus.Delete(lcId))```
