Loads the `.oData` member with a record accessed by PK. This method or a specialized version of it should be used to load with record level objects and return them to the caller.You can overload this method to allow object nesting and auto-loading of sub objects. For example, an oInvoice object may contain an oCustomer object. From `oInvoice.Load()` you can call `oInvoice.oCustomer.Load()` to automatically load the related customer record so the client application never has to explicitly load the customer record.The default behavior of Load is to do a `SCATTER NAME` by running a SQL statement to retrieve all the data from a record (`SELECT *`) using the PK as the key. If you want you can override this behavior in a variety of ways:**Create a new object and use it for the oData member**You can simply override Load to use your own object and populate the data of its members as you see fit. Heck, you can SCATTER from a completely different table if that makes sense.```foxprooInvoice.oData = CREATEOBJECT("cMyCustomData")oInvoice.oData.Company="westwind"```Just be careful when you save to a SQL datasource - the fields in the object must match the fields in the database if you use the autoupdate features. But if you use a custom object you most likely will handle updates to the datasource manually anyway.**Run a custom SQL statement and do SCATTER NAME of that**```foxproFUNCTION LoadLPARAMETER lnPKTHIS.SetError()IF EMPTY(lnpk)   THIS.SetError("Load failed - no key passed.")   RETURN .F.ENDIFIF !THIS.OPEN()   RETURN .F.ENDIFDO CASE CASE THIS.ndatamode = 0      lckey = "PK"      * **OVERRIDDEN SQL STATEMENT         	  SELECT wwmb_Messages.*,wwmb_Forums.ForumName,wwmb_Boards.Path ;	      FROM wwmb_messages, wwmb_forums, wwmb_boards ;	      WHERE wwmb_Messages.PK = lnPK AND ;	            wwmb_Messages.ForumPk = wwmb_Forums.PK AND ;	            wwmb_Messages.BoardPk = wwmb_Boards.pk ;	      INTO CURSOR TQuery      IF _TALLY > 0         SCATTER NAME THIS.oData MEMO         THIS.nUpdateMode = 1 && Edit      ELSE         SCATTER NAME THIS.oData BLANK         THIS.SetError("GetRecord - Record not found.")         RETURN .F.      ENDIF   CASE THIS.ndatamode = 2		THIS.oSQL.cSQL = ;			[SELECT wwmb_Messages.*,wwmb_Forums.ForumName,wwmb_Boards.Path]   +;			[   FROM wwmb_messages, wwmb_forums, wwmb_boards]   +;			[   WHERE wwmb_Messages.PK = ] + TRANSFORM( lnPK ) + [AND]   +;			[         wwmb_Messages.ForumPk = wwmb_Forums.PK AND]   +;			[         wwmb_Messages.BoardPk = wwmb_Boards.pk]         lnResult = THIS.osql.Execute()      IF lnResult # 1         THIS.SetError(THIS.osql.cErrorMsg)         RETURN .F.      ENDIF      IF RECCOUNT() > 0         SCATTER NAME THIS.oData MEMO         THIS.nUpdateMode = 1 && Edit      ELSE         SCATTER NAME THIS.oData BLANK MEMO         THIS.SetError("No match found.")         RETURN .F.      ENDIFENDCASE```As you can see here I'm scattering from a custom SQL statement rather than using the stock that would access only the local table. Note that if you use a SQL backend you should use the cSkipFieldsForUpdates property to filter out the fields that are not part of the primary datasource in order to have the auto-save features work correctly as they generate a SQL UPDATE/INSERT statement from the object property signature.
