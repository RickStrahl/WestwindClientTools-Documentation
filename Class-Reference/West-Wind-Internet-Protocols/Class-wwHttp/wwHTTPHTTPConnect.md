This HTTP method initiates a low level HTTP request for use with HTTPGetEx by establishing an IP Session and connecting to a target server. The main purpose of this method is to specify the server name and the security options when connecting.> **Note: Use [HTTPGet](vfps://Topic/_0JJ1AJETM) instead!**  > HttpGet provides all the functionality of HttpConnect/HttpGetEx, but is much easier to use,and ensures proper cleanup of resources.
