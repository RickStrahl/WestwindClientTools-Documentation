This method is the full featured HTTP access method that provides full support for the HTTP protocol including POST data, Basic Authentication and HTTPS protocol support. Requires HTTPConnect() to open a connection first and HTTPClose() to shut down.> **Note: Use [HTTPGet](vfps://Topic/_0JJ1AJETM) instead!**  > HttpGet provides most of the functionality of the low level HttpConnect/HttpGetEx combo, but is easier and more reliable as it handles all the connection setup/cleanup automatically.</blockquote></small>
