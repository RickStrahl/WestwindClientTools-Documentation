Receives data until either the provided string is found or the request times out based on the nTimeout property setting.

This method is very useful for long data streams that usually would require multiple Receive() requests. Since TCP/IP buffering determines how much data Receive() returns retrieving large data streams or data when the connection is bad usually requires a loop. Using this method avoids writing the loop syntax in your application code and wraps this functionality into this method.
