wwIPStuff ships in two versions:* **Packaged and installed with West Wind Web Connection**  * **As a standalone shareware package**  The standalone package is meant for users that are not using wwIPStuff as part of Web Connection. If you own Web Connection and you have a newer version of wwIPStuff, make sure you only install the following files:* wwIPStuff.vcx/vct  * wwIPStuff.dllDon't install wwUtils, wwAPI and any other support files as the files shipped with the standalone version of wwIPStuff are limited and don't include all the functionality of the same files in the Web Connection Framework.
