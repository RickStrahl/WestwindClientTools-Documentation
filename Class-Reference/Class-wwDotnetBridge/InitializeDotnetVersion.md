Use this function in your application's startup program to force the .NET Runtime version to be used by `wwDotnetBridge` for the entire application. This loads the runtime and thus determines the runtime that will be used for the entire application making calls with `wwDotnetBridge`.Just put the following some in your application's startup code:```foxproInitializeDotnetVersion()```> ### @icon-warning Important > This is an important feature and we **highly recommend** you add the above line of code **to the startup code of every application** that uses `wwDotnetBridge`.### Why do this?Calling this method forces the .NET Runtime version to a specific version and caches it. You are **explicitly** setting the version that's used by `wwDotnetBridge` throughout your application, so any attempt to create a new instance of `wwDotnetBridge` always creates an instance in this same runtime version.> Each application can host only a single instance of the .NET Runtime and this function sets the version once on startup of the application so you can ensure consistent runtime version usage.
