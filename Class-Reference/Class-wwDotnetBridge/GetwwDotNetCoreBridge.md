Factory method that can be used to create a `PUBLIC` instance of the `wwDotNetBridge` class. Use this method instead of explicitly instantiating the class to avoid recreating the .NET object wrapper object each time.A PUBLIC instance named `__DOTNETBRIDGE` is created and cached. Calling this function either creates or reuses the existing instance.```foxproDO wwDotNetBridge    && somewhere to load libraryloBridge = GetwwDotNetCoreBridge()loBridge.LoadAssembly("FULLPATH('rtfConverter.dll')")loConverter = loBridge.CreateInstance("rtfConverter.rtfConverter")```
