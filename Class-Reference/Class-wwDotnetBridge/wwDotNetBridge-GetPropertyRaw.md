Works the same as `GetProperty()`.  but while that method returns a fixed up FoxPro friendly value, this method tries to return the raw result value directly as a .NET type. You can also prevent the instance type from being fixed up via the `llNoInstanceFixup` parameter.> This method is unsafe and may result in errors if result types are invalid for use in FoxPro which result in *Function argument value, type or count is invalid* errors.Use this method in scenarios where a type may be fixed up normally by returning a wrapper object like `ComValue` or `ComArray` or for types that have multiple representations like `char` (return string vs. number) and `Guid` (returns string vs. binary guid) for example.### Slightly Faster but make sure you actually need it!If you know your type is 'safe' to convert, this method can be slightly faster than `GetProperty()` as it bypasses the inbound and outgoing type checking. However, in most cases where this applies **you can also directly access the underlying property** on the instance without `GetProperty()` which should always be your first choice for performance and readability.
