The `wwDotnetCoreBridge` is a subclass of wwDotnetBridge class that **shares the same features as the `wwDotnetBridge` class**, but works against .NET Core Runtimes. After initial loading of the runtime, both libraries have the same feature set. For detailed member documentation please see the [wwDotnetBridge class](VFPS://Topic/_24N1CFW3A).`wwDotnetCoreBridge` loads the **32 bit .NET Core Runtime** and provides a class factory and proxy implementation to create instances and access features that COM does not natively expose. The only difference between `wwDotnetBridge` and `wwDotnetCoreBridge` is how they are instantiated. `wwDotnetCoreBridge` is instantiated like this:```foxpro*** Default: Uses highest .NET Core 32 bit Runtime installedloBridge = CREATEOBJECT("wwDotnetCoreBridge")*** Or use cached version: One instance that gets cachedloBridge = GetwwDotnetCoreBridge()```or you can specify a specific .NET Core 32 bit Runtime version number or runtime installation path:```foxpro*** By version numberloBridge = CREATEOBJECT("wwDotnetCoreBridge","6.0.5")  && or partial versions 6, 6.0 etc.*** By Runtime Folder *** - allows for private runtime or self-contained application installsloBridge = CREATEOBJECT("wwDotnetCoreBridge",              "C:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\5.0.17")```For all features, please refer to the main [wwDotnetBridge documentation](VFPS://Topic/_24N1CFW3A).> #### @icon-info-circle FoxPro uses the 32 bit .NET Core Runtimes> **Important**: FoxPro is a 32 bit application and so it needs to run the **32 bit version of the .NET Core Runtimes or SDK**. The 32 bit versions are separate and non-default installations, and they are installed in:  > `c:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\`### ExampleThere are no major differences between `wwDotnetBridge` and `wwDotnetCoreBridge` so the code you write with either is identical other than the class instantiation.Here's an example:```foxproCLEARSET MEMOWIDTH TO 255do wwDotNetBridgeLOCAL loBridge as wwDotNetBridgeloBridge = GetwwDotnetCoreBridge()*** Should echo .NET Core version information? loBridge.GetDotnetVersion()*** Load a .NET Core AssemblyIF !loBridge.Loadassembly(".\NetCoreFromFoxPro\NetCoreFromFoxPro\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.0\NetCoreFromFoxPro.dll")   ?
