Retrieves a .NET Enumerated value by passing in a string representation and retrieving the corresponding numeric value.Note that VFP Intellisense (if available) can also furnish this value to you directly as a numeric value which is more efficient. But this only works if the type is registered for COM Interop (most are not) and when you have it referenced explicitly in your code as the COM type using a LOCAL declaration.
