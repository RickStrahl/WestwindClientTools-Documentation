On occasion you'll find .NET APIs that pass parameters by reference. Thankfully by ref parameters are rare since it's much easier to return objects then return values via parameters, but nevertheless there are a few APIs that require ref or out parameters.Making these calls is not quite obvious with wwDotnetBridge. There are essentially two ways that you can make these calls:* Using direct COM Access of .NET objects* Using ComValue Parameters in InvokeMethod/InvokeStaticMethod calls### Direct Call SyntaxYou can pass and retrieve reference parameters in .NET easily if you're using direct call syntax.Assume the following function signature:```csharppublic void PassByReference(ref int intValue, string stringValue, ref decimal decimalValue){    intValue = intValue*2;    decimalValue = decimalValue*2;    stringValue += " Updated!";}```And you can easily call it with code like the following:```foxproloNet = loBridge.Createinstance("Westwind.WebConnection.TypePassingTests")lnInt = 10lnDecimal = 5.22lcString = "Hello World."loNet.PassByReference(@lnInt,lcString,@lnDecimal)? lnInt,lnDecimal,lcString```Note that I'm using direct access of the function I am calling (loNet.PassByReference() call) and COM handles mapping the ref parameters automatically.### Passing Arrays by ReferenceTo pass arrays by reference works the same way as above although it's not quite as obvious. You still need to assign the array to a ComValue structure, but most importantly you need to apply the array explictly to the value structure: ```foxproloStrings = loBridge.CreateArray("System.String")loStrings.AddItem("It's")loStrings.AddItem("BigDay")LOCAL loValue as Westwind.WebConnection.ComValueloValue = loBridge.CreateComValue()loBridge.SetProperty(loValue,"Value",loStrings)lobridge.InvokeMethod(loNet,"PassArrayByReference",loValue)loStringsResult =  loBridge.GetProperty(loValue,"Value")? loStringsResult.Count```### Using ComValue with InvokeMethod/InvokeMethodStaticFirst lets show what **does not work**:```foxproloNet = loBridge.CreateInstance("Westwind.WebConnection.TypePassingTests")lnInt = 10lnDecimal = 5.22lcString = "Hello World."loNet.InvokeMethod(loNet,"PassByReference",@lnInt,lcString,@lnDecimal)? lnInt,lnDecimal,lcString```The reason this doesn't work is that indirect calls pass the parameters through 2 additional API layers and in that process the ByRef linkage is lost.To get around this you can use the ComValue class to hold your ByRef parameters. ComValue parameters pass their value to a function and also receive that value back on function call completion effectively providing the semblance of ByRef parameters. The syntax to do this is a little more verbose.Assume you have a method like this:```csharppublic void PassByReference(ref int intValue, string stringValue, ref decimal decimalValue){    intValue = intValue*2;    decimalValue = decimalValue*2;    stringValue += " Updated!"; }```Note that 2 of the parameters that are numeric are passed by reference.To call this method from FoxPro looks like this:```foxproLOCAL loNet as Westwind.WebConnection.TypePassingTestsloNet = loBridge.Createinstance("Westwind.WebConnection.TypePassingTests")*** Pass parameters by Reference*** Create ComValue objects for each parameterloInt = loBridge.CreateComValue()loInt.Value = INT(10)loDecimal = loBridge.CreateComValue()loDecimal.Value = CAST( 5.22 as Currency)? "Original:"? loInt.Value, loDecimal.Value*** Call the method and pass ComArray parameterloBridge.InvokeMethod(loNet,;                            "PassByReference",;                            loInt,"Hello World",loDecimal)*** Look at the result values? "Updated:"? loInt.Value, loDecimal.Value```Notice the use of the ComValue class to assign a value and then also retrieving the value back after the call is complete. If ComValue is used for a parameter wwDotnetBridge always updates the ComValue.Value property with the updated value after the call is complete. You can read this value and treat it as if it was passed by directly through a ByRef assignment.
