.NET's default policy does not allow for loading of .NET assemblies (.dll files) from remote network locations. When attempting to load an assembly off a network path instead you get a network exception that complains about security policy.You can override this behavior with a configuration setting in your EXE's .config file. ```xml<configuration>  <runtime>     <loadFromRemoteSources enabled="true"/>  </runtime></configuration>```The key is the loadFromRemoteSource key which can be set to allow remote .DLL loading to occur.Note that a .config file must be set up **for whatever top level EXE file is running the application**. This means:* YourApp.exe.config   (your own EXE)* VFP9.exe.config    (running VFP IDE)> **Note:** Config file `<loadFromRemoteSources>` only works in .NET 4.0 later. Older versions of .NET require use of the CASPOL.EXE tool to explicitly set policy for the executable or machine.
