Struct types are value types and can't be accessed directly over COM in FoxPro. This means you can't simply use `.CreateInstance()` to create a Struct type with wwDotnetBridge.It's still possible to create a struct type and use it, but the code is pretty ugly. The following works:```foxpro*** Parameter array for constructor (empty)loComArray = loBridge.Createarray()  *** Create a ComValue structure where we hold the StructloValue = loBridge.CreateComValue(null)*** Create the instance and store in loValue.ValueloValue.SetValueFromCreateInstance("Westwind.WebConnection.StructValue",loComArray)*** To use the type - loStruct.IntValue*** Must access double indirectly from ComValue*** Don't reference .Value or you get error? loBridge.GetProperty(loValue,"Value.IntValue")```This code relies on the [ComValue Class](VFPS://Topic/_3481232SD) in the .NET component to hold the structure as an intermediary. You can then use the `.SetValueFromCreateInstance()` to create the instance and reference the `.Value` member indirectly.Note that `.SetValueFromCreateInstance()` takes a `ComArray` as a parameter which has to be passed even if there are no parameters so that the method signature can be found.
