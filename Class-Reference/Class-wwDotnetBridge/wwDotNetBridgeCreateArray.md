Creates a new [ComArray](vfps://Topic/Class%20ComArray) instance based on the .NET type you specify as a parameter.ComArray is a wwDotnetBridge wrapper type that can be passed to InvokeMethod() or SetProperty() and is converted by wwDotNetBridge into the native array type that is stored in the Value property thus allow keeping the array entirely in .NET without having to be marshaled into FoxPro arrays.This method has an overloaded parameter that either accepts an array instance from which to construct a ComArray instance, or a string of the element's full .NET type name (like System.Net.MailMessage).
