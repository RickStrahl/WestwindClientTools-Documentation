Use this function in your application's startup program to force the 32 bit .NET Core Runtime version to be used by `wwDotnetBridgeCore` for the entire application. This loads the runtime and thus determines the runtime that will be used for the entire application making calls with `wwDotnetBridgeCore`.> #### @icon-info-circle FoxPro uses the 32 bit .NET Core Runtimes> **Important**: FoxPro is a 32 bit application and so it needs to run the **32 bit version of the .NET Core Runtimes or SDK**. The 32 bit versions are separate and non-default installations of the .NET Core runtime, and they are installed in:  > `c:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\`To load the .NET Core version of wwDotnetBridge that loads the latest installed version of the .NET Core Runtime:```foxproInitializeDotnetCoreVersion()         && highest version```or to specify a specific version:```foxproInitializeDotnetCoreVersion("6.0.1")```or the highest installed version for the provides version part:```foxproInitializeDotnetCoreVersion("6.0")   && loads highest 6.0.x versionInitializeDotnetCoreVersion("6")   && loads highest 6.x.x version```or you can specify an explicit runtime folder:```foxproInitializeDotnetCoreVersion("C:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\5.0.17")```The 32 bit .NET Core Runtime version you specify - either implicitly or explicitly - **has to be  installed on the machine**.> ### @icon-warning Important > This is an important feature and we **highly recommend** you add the above line of code **to the startup code of every application** that uses `wwDotnetBridgeCore`.### Why do this?Calling this method forces the .NET Core Runtime version to a specific version. You are **explicitly** setting the .NET Core version that's used by `wwDotnetCoreBridge` throughout your application, so any attempt to create a new instance of `wwDotnetCoreBridge` always creates an instance in this same runtime version.> Each application can host only a single instance of the .NET Core Runtime and this function sets the version.
