Factory method that can be used to create a `PUBLIC` instance of the `wwDotNetBridge` class. Use this method instead of explicitly instantiating the class to avoid recreating the .NET object wrapper object each time.   This helper caches the .NET hosted proxy instance so it doesn't have to be reinstantiated each time you `CREATEOBJECT()`. Instead the cached instance is returned if it exists.Here's how to use it:```foxproDO wwDotNetBridge    && load the load libraryloBridge = GetwwDotNetBridge()loBridge.LoadAssembly("FULLPATH('rtfConverter.dll')")loConverter = loBridge.CreateInstance("rtfConverter.rtfConverter")```
