Array handling through .NET requires special handling as FoxPro arrays do not marshal well over COM Interop boundaries. To make common array and collection easier to use, wwDotnetBridge provides a [ComArray](vfps://Topic/Class%20ComArray) wrapper class that acts as a proxy around a .NET Enumerable (array or collection).When using `InvokeMethod` or `GetProperty` and returning arrays from the method call,  wwDotNetBridge automatically fixes up any returned arrays or collections as a `ComArray`.You can also create `ComArray` instances directly and through it manipulate .NET arrays using FoxPro code easily. You can add, edit and remove elements of this one dimensional array and then pass the ComArray as an array parameter using the indirect access methods of `InvokeMethod()` and `SetProperty()` to pass or assign values instead of directly calling the method or setting a property.### What is ComArray and how does it work?ComArray works by keeping arrays entirely inside of .NET, never passing the array type to FoxPro, so no array conversion occurs. Rather methods are used to set, retrieve and manipulate individual array elements which provides full access to elements without having to pass the array into FoxPro. This is more efficient, but most importantly it makes it possible for FoxPro to manipulate .NET arrays and collections easily and consistently which is not possible with plain FoxPro arrays. Here are a few examples that demonstrate typical usage scenarios:### Retrieve an Array ResultArray and Collection results retrieved with GetProperty/InvokeMethod() are automatically turned into [ComArray](vfps://Topic/Class%20ComArray) instances which make it easy to manipulate a .NET array.```foxproloBridge = CREATEOBJECT("wwDotNetBridge")loService = loBridge.CreateInstance("WebStoreService.WebStoreConsumerService")*** ComArray instance returned - method returns an Array of WebStoreService.wws_itemloArray = loBridge.InvokeMethod(loService,"GetItemArray","Web Development Tools")*** Loop through the array - array is 0 basedFOR lnX = 0 to loArray.Count -1   loItem = loArray.Item(lnX)          ? loItem.Sku     ? loItem.DescriptENDFOR```### Manipulate the Array and pass back to .NETComArray instances can then also be passed back to .NET methods and property values when using InvokeMethod/SetProperty respectively. Using the code above loArray is a ComArray instance and you can update with code like the following:```foxproloBridge = CREATEOBJECT("wwDotNetBridge")loService = loBridge.CreateInstance("WebStoreService.WebStoreConsumerService")*** ComArray instance returnedloArray = loBridge.InvokeMethod(loService,"GetItemArray","Web Development Tools")*** Create a new object typed to the Array's element base type (WebStoreService.wws_item here)loiIem = loArray.CreateItem()  *** Last statement is the same as this*loItem = loBridge.CreateInstance("WebStoreService.wws_Item")loItem.Sku = "NewSKU"loItem.Descript = "New item"*** Add a new item to the existing arrayloArray.AddItem(loItem)*** Method that expects an Item array - we're passing our ComArray instanceloBridge.InvokeMethod(loService,"UpdateItemList",loArray)```Note that you have to use InvokeMethod() rather than a direct method call to pass the array back to .NET. This ensures that the array never passes into Visual FoxPro.You can also remove an item:```foxproloArray.RemoveItem(0)  && 0 based index```or you can clear the entire array of items:```foxproloArray.Clear()```**Assigning a Property**  Along the same lines you can take a ComArray and assign it to a property. There are two options to do this.```foxproloItem = loBridge.CreateInstance("WebStoreService.wws_Item")loItem.Sku = "NewSKU"loItem.Descript = "New item"loArray.AddItem(loItem)*** Assign the array to the loItem.Items propertyloArray.AssignTo(loService,"Items")```or using wwDotnetBridge directly:```foxpro*** Assign the loArray to the Items array propertyloBridge.SetProperty(loService,"Items",loArray)```### Create a new Array and pass to .NETYou can also create a new ComArray instance directly rather than receiving one back form from a .NET method or property as in the last examples. To do this you create a ComArray instance using wwDotnetBridge.CreateArray() method:```foxpro*** Create the ComArray instance and specify the item type's full nameloArray = loBridge.CreateArray("WebStoreService.wws_Item")*** Now add items*loItem = loBridge.CreateInstance("WebStoreService.wws_Item")loItem = loItem.CreateItem()   && Creates a WebStoreService.wws_Item instanceloItem.Sku = "NewSKU"loItem.Descript = "New item"loArray.AddItem(loItem)loItem = loItem.CreateItem()  loItem.Sku = "NewSKU2"loItem.Descript = "New item 2"loArray.AddItem(loItem)*** Method that expects an Item array - we're passing our ComArray instanceloBridge.InvokeMethod(loService,"UpdateItemList",loArray)```Once the array exists you can then again use `InvokeMethod()` to pass it as a parameter of a method or use `ComArray.AssignTo()` or `SetProperty()` to set a property. As before you can't pass or set the ComArray directly on the .NET object instance - you need to use the indirect methods.
