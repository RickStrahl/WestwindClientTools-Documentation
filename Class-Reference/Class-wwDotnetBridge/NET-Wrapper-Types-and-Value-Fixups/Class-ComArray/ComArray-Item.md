Returns an item **by index** or **by key** from an Array, List or Dictionary collection.This works on (keytype):* Array   (int)* Array List  (int) * IList       (int) * ICollection  (any type) * HashSet      (any type) * IDictionary  (key type) (or int for index)You can specify either an integer for list types or any type for collections. int keys are 0 based.> For dictionaries `int` values retrieve the item at the specified indexed location, **unless the Dictionary key type is `int`**. >> If the key type is `int` (or a FoxPro number) the `int` key is **treated as a key value, rather than an index**. For all other key types, the key is treated as an index.
