Returns an item by index or key from a List or Dictionary collection without any type conversion for FoxPro.> This function may fail if the array item type is not compatible with FoxPro, typically with an *Function argument value, type or count is invalid* error. This may be useful for some types like `char` or `Guid` that are returned differently for fixups.This works on:* Array   (int)* Array List  (int) * IList       (int) * ICollection  (any type) * HashSet      (any type) * IDictionary  (key type) (or int for index)You can specify either an integer for list types or any type for collections. int keys are 0 based.> For dictionaries `int` values retrieve the item at the specified indexed location, **unless the Dictionary key type is `int`**. >> If the key type is `int` (or a FoxPro number) the `int` key is **treated as a key value, rather than an index**. For all other key types, the key is treated as an index.
