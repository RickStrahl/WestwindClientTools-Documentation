Creates a new instance of one of the list/collection's data type without actually adding it to the array, and returns the created object instance.It's a shortcut to explicitly using `CreateInstance(arrayElementType)`, which makes it easier create empty objects that can be populated in FoxPro without specifying the full type name each time, resulting in cleaner code in FoxPro.
