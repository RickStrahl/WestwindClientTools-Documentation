COM Wrapper for Arrays, IList and IDictionary collections that are not directly or easily accessible in FoxPro. Provides members like `Count`, `Item()` for index or key retrieval, `AddItem()`, `AddDictionaryItem()`, `RemoveItem()`, `Clear()` to provide common collection operations more naturally in FoxPro abstracted for the different types of collections available in .NET (Arrays, Lists, Hash tables, Dictionaries).Internally stores an instance of the collection so the collection is never actually passed to FoxPro. Instead this class acts as a proxy to the collection which is stored in the `.Instance` property.This instance allows Visual FoxPro to manipulate the collection by directly accessing array, list or dictionary values by index or key (depending on list or collection), adding, removing and clearing items, creating array, list and dictionary instances and assigning and picking up these  values from existing objects.This class is also internally used to capture collections that are returned from method calls or Properties via `InvokeMethod()` and `GetProperty()` and can be used to pass collections to .NET which otherwise would not be possible over COM.* [More info and examples](VFPS://Topic/_3M90JXXXM)
