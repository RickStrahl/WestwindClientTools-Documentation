This useful method allows you to turn **any .NET Method** you call into an asynchronously called method that returns a callback to you on completion rather than an immediate result.Use this method to turn long running methods into async callbacks that return only when the method completes while your mainline code can continue to run. Great for offloading HTTP requests, and downloads while other code can continue to run.Uses the [AsyncCallbackEvents](VFPS://Topic/Class%20AsyncCallbackEvents) class to receive notifications when requests complete or fail (see example).
