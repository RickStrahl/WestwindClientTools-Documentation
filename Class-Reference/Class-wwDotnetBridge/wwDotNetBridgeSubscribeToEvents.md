Allows you to capture events on a source object, by passing in a callback handler that maps the events of the target object with corresponding methods on the handler.To handle events:* **Create an Event Handler Object**  Create a `Custom` class that implements methods that match the events of the .NET object that fires events with a `On<EventName>` prefix. Each 'asdd' method's parameters should match the parameters of the .NET event delegate. You only need to implement the methods you want to listen to - other events are ignored.* **Create an Event Subscription**  Call `loBridge.SubscribeToEvents()` which binds a .NET event source object to a FoxPro event handler.* **Continue running your Application**  Events are handled asynchronously in .NET and run in the background. Your application continues running and as events fire in .NET, the `On<Event>` methods are fired on the Event Handler object in FoxPro.* **Unsubscribe from the Event Subscription**   When you no longer want to listen to events, call `loSubscription.UnSubscribe()`. Make sure you do this before you exit FoxPro or you may crash VFP on shutdown.
