Returns an item from an `IDictionary` collection by key.Dictionary items can't be directly accessed via COM, as .NET doesn't expose keyed collections in a manner that COM can use directly. This function provides a wrapper that lets you easily retrieve a dictionary item by its key value. This allows easy access to retrieve values by key for C# code like this:```csvar dictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>() {    { "name", "Rick" },    { "company", "West Wind" }};var name = dictionary["name"];var company = dictionary["company"];```Using `GetDictionaryItem()` you can access the same collection in FoxPro like this:```foxproloDictionary = loService.GetDictionary();  && Dictionary<string,string>lcName = loBridge.GetDictionaryItem(loDictionary, "name")lcCompany = loBridge.GetDictionaryItem(loDictionary, "company")```> Note dictionaries can have keys and values of **any type**. The example here uses `<string, string>` but that's just one common combination. Dictionaries could be `<string, object>` or `<string, decimal>` or `<object, MyType>`.
