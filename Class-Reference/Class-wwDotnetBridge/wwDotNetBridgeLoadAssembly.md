Loads a .NET assembly into the .NET Runtime currently executing. Note that you should ensure that any required assemblies and dependent assemblies are loaded explicitly into the runtime.If the runtime has not been started explicitly it will be launched when this method is called.wwDotnetBridge loads `System.Core` (which includes all the base BCL System libraries contained in `System`).
