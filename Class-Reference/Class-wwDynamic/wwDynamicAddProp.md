This method explicitly adds a new property to this `wwDynamic` instance **and** it automatically adds the property to the `__PropertyNameOverrides` list which is used during JSON serialization to produce properly cased serialization output.The primary use case for this method is:* If you need to preserve property name case for JSON Serialization* If you need better performance for adding properties* Set properties with internal FoxPro base class names:  `Name`, `Class`, `Tag`, `Parent` etc.Here are some examples that demonstrate:```foxproloMessage = CREATEOBJECT("wwDynamic")*** Create a name propertyloMessage.name = "Rick"*** same as (no benefit since name is already lower case always)loMessage.AddProp("name","Rick")*** This has benefit of supporting mixed cases via __PropertyNameOverridesloMessage.AddProp("lastName","Strahl")*** This loses mixed case for property name serializationloMessage.lastName = "Strahl"```> This method has a funky name of `AddProp()` as it cannot have the same name as `AddProperty()` which is a base class method that can't be completely overridden. Hence the alternate name to avoid the base class firing and failing on creation of FoxPro reserved properties.
