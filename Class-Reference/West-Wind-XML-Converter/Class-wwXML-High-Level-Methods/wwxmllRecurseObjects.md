Allows to recurse child objects hierarchically. When .T. any object member willl be parsed and embedded hierarchically in the XML document.

Be very careful with this however since this can result in deadlock situations where objects reference themselves lower in the hierarchy. It's highly recommended that you use [cPropertyExclusionList](vfps://Topic/wwxml%3A%3AcPropertyExclusionList) to exclude any objects that might recurse onto themselves.
