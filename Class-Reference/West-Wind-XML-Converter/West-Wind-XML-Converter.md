Welcome to wwXML, a class that provides easy conversion routines to and from Visual FoxPro cursors and objects. 

The class provides:

* Object -> XML
* Cursor -> XML
* Cursor -> ADO Compatible XML
* XML -> Object
* XML -> Cursor
* .NET DataSet -> Cursor
* ADO Compatible XML -> Cursor**  

The import routines are not fully generic - they rely on either an existing cursor and specific[ XML structures](vfps://Topic/%20XML%20structures) shown in the examples here. The cursor structures are compatible but extended versions of the SQL Server schemas used by SQL 2000.
