Creates a Schema string from the currently active cursor/alias. The schema is generated as separate schema string.

Note that the schema created is for the cursor fragment only and does not include the document root. This makes it possible to create multiple schemas into a single document and link them in from within the document. CursorToXML handles creation of embedded schemas that take advantage of this fact through thte nCreateDataStructure=1 flag.
