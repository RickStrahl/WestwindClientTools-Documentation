`ShellExecute()` is an API wrapper around the Windows API with the same name. Using `ShellExecute()` you can:* Open Web URLs* Open files by filename in their associated application * Open local folders in Explorer* Open Application Protocol Handlers* Open OS applications that are on the OS path without a pathHere are some examples:```foxproShellExecute("https://west-wind.com")     && opens in Web BrowserShellExecute("c:\temp")                   && opens folder in ExplorerShellExecute("c:\temp\test.pdf")          && opens PDF in PDF viewerShellExecute("skype:8083215555")          && Opens SkypeShellExecute("markdownmonster:untitled")  && Opens associated applicationShellExecute("code")                      && Opens VS Code (if installed)```ShellExecute can also execute commands with a complex commandline. Unlike the `RUN` command `ShellExecute()` works with long filenames or filenames with spaces in them.```foxproShellExecute("c:\Program Files (x86)\Markdown Monster\mm.exe", ;             "OPEN","c:\temp",;              ["c:\temp\Getting Started With MM.md" ".\test.md"])```For command line execution you might find `ExecuteCommandline()` a little simpler as you can write it the same way as you would from the Terminal as a single line:```foxproExecuteCommandLine([c:\Program Files\Markdown Monster\mm.exe "c:\temp\Getting Started With MM.md"])```
