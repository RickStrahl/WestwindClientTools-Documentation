Flatten a SQL command that contains CHR(13) or CHR(10) characters into a single line by stripping out the CR/LF values and replacing them with a space.Useful in code so you can write SQL expressions using multi-line SQL between `TEXT` and `ENDTEXT`.For example:```foxproTEXT TO lcSql NOSHOWSELECT id, title, description    FROM albums    ORDER BY titleENDTEXT* &lcSql   && failslcSql = FlattenSql(lcSql)&lcSql   && works```
