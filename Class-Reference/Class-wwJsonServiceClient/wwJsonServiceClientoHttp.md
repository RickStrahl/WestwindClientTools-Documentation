The [wwHttp](VFPS://Topic/_0JJ1ABF2K) instance that is used for HTTP access. A **new instance is created for every request** using the `CreatewwHttp()` method at the beginning of the request. If you need to modify request behavior you have to first call `CreatewwHttp()` or you can override the method to do it for every request.```foxproloClient = CREATEOBJECT("wwJsonServiceClient")loClient.CreatewwHttp();  loClient.oHttp.AddHeader("Authorization", lcBearerToken)loClient.oHttp.nTimeout = 15loClient.CallService(...)```
