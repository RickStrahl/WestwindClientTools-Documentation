The base Url for the service. Optional but useful to allow switching between test/live deployments without having to hardcode URLs.```foxpro*** TestcServiceUrl = "https://test-albumviewer.west-wind.com/api/"*** Production* cServiceUrl = "https://albumviewer.west-wind.com/api/"```Then in code instead of using the full URL you can use build up the URL:```foxprothis.CallService(this.cServiceUrl + "albums")```
