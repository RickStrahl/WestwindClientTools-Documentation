Unzips a Zip file into a folder structure maintaining the zip files directory structure.

If the folder doesn't exists it is created assuming the folder name is valid. The folder is not overwritten first so existing files that are not in the archive are preserved. If you wish a 'clean' unzip operation, delete the folder and any contents prior to unpacking.
