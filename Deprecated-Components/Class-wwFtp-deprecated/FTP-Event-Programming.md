The FTP class allows for minimal event handling during file up and download operations. Using FTPGetFileEx and FTPSendFileEx data is downloaded in configurable chunk sizes. After each chunk is retrieved the [OnFTPBufferUpdate](vfps://Topic/wwftp%3A%3Aonftpbufferupdate) event fires, which receives information about the current request. It returns the number of bytes already sent, the numbe of chunks and the current buffer available. In addtion, this method allows the ability to set the [lCancelDownload](vfps://Topic/wwftp%3A%3Alcanceldownload) property to .T. to force the current request to be aborted and returning control to the calling code.
