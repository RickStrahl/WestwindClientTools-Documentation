> We no longer support this class as it's old and dated. This class was never meant to be a full featured POP3 client but rather as a server support class to help with validating email confirmations. It continues to work for basic scenarios, but please don't use it for sophisticated mail processing or email integrations.

The wwPOP3 class can be used to read email from POP3 mail boxes. 

This class works only with plain text logins. If your mailbox requires encrypted logins this class will not work.

wwPOP3.prg is an example of using the wwSocket class to do low level socket access to interact with a server application.
